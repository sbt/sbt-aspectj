sbt-aspectj
===========

[sbt] plugin for weaving with [aspectj]. This plugin requires sbt 0.12.


Add plugin
----------

Add plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`. For example:

    addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-aspectj" % "0.8.1")


Sample projects
---------------

There are [runnable sample projects][samples] included as sbt scripted tests.


Example settings
----------------

Set the aspectj inputs, the jars which should be instrumented. This is an
ordered sequence of jars where instrumentation can be chained.

    inputs in Aspectj <<= update map { report =>
      report.matching(moduleFilter(organization = "se.scalablesolutions.akka", name = "akka-actor" | "akka-remote")).sortBy(_.name)
    }

Set the aspect filter, to map jars to aspects:

    aspectFilter in Aspectj := {
      (jar, aspects) => {
        if (jar.name.contains("akka-actor")) aspects filter (_.name.startsWith("Actor"))
        else if (jar.name.contains("akka-remote")) aspects filter (_.name.startsWith("Remote"))
        else Seq.empty[File]
      }
    }

Replace the original jars in the test classpath with the instrumented jars:

    fullClasspath in Test <<= SbtAspectj.useInstrumentedJars(Test)


Weave
-----

The command to run the aspectj compiler is `aspectj:weave`.


Mailing list
------------

Please use the [sbt mailing list][email] and prefix the subject with `[sbt-aspectj]`.
